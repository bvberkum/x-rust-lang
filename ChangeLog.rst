  Initial experiments with docopt and tokio. All example code found online.

  Would want to combine libs in background-docopt for local-bg use-case. But
  need to learn more about tokio's Futures and Rust programming general.

  Something more straightforward like stream processing, CLI program setup,
  maybe some service interaction. Before returning to TCP server setup.
